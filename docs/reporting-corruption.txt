It is also important to note that every person is free to report anything they deem related to corruption. Corruption here covers issues such as common bribery (soliciting, accepting, and giving bribes), fraud, money laundering, insider trading, nepotism, conflict of interest, embezzlement e.t.c. A person has two choices when reporting to the D.C.E.C. You can choose to be anonymous or choose to disclose your identity. Reporting anonymously will assist in concealing your identity and alleviate fear of being victimized by those you report. However, feedback between the D.C.E.C and yourself will be compromised since there will be no communication. The D.C.E.C also offers services in corruption prevention and sensitization such as; corruption risk assessment anti corruption audits anti corruption training and corruption prevention committees formation and capacitation Who is eligible?
