Who is eligible? All members of the public are eligible to apply for a restraining order. How do I get this service? Applicants must file an application to the clerk of their local Magistrate's Court. After the application has been filed, it is allocated a case number. The matter is then assigned to a magistrate who will then allocate a date of the hearing.

It is the responsibility of the applicant to serve or pay for the serving of the restraining order to the other party. In cases of domestic violence, police officers may be asked to serve the restraining order to the other party.
