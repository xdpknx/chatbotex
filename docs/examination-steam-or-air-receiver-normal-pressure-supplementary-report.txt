This process is intended to minimise the risk of explosions or other malfunctions possible for pressure vessels. As steam boilers and air receivers operate under pressure greater than atmospheric pressure, this inspection is therefore deemed important. Operators must keep the official report, logging each inspection, on the same premises as the equipment in question and it must be made available to DOHS personnel for inspection at any time. Who is eligible? Citizens and non-citizens companies with Steam or Air Receivers How do I get this service? Operators must hire the services of an authorised examiner from the list of authorised examiners. This list is updated throughout the year. Once an inspection by an authorised examiner has taken place, the examiner is required by law to issue a report to the operator detailing and assessing the state of the equipment in question. This report must be kept in the official log of the operator and available for inspection by DOHS personnel. What supporting documents are required?
