Any party entitled and desiring to demand security in case at the High court/ Court of Appeal can apply for an assessment of security. How do I get this service?

The Registrar will then assess the validity of the claim for security and the amount and provide directive on the manner of payment. If the amount being requested is contested by the other party, the Registrar shall make the final decision on the amount to be given. If the other party disagrees with the need to provide security or does not pay the amount ordered within ten(10) days of the Registrar’s decision, the party demanding security may request that the judge halt the proceedings until the amounts are paid. If payments are still not made, the judge may strike out any pleadings made by the party refusing to pay or take other actions as necessary. What supporting documents are required? Submit a written notice to the Registrar of the high court (if pending appearance before a judge) or to a Judge of the high court/ Court of Appeal The notice must outline the reasons for requesting security and the amount requested.
