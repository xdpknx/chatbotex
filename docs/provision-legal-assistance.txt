In Civil cases, any party who desires to sue and defend as a poor litigant may apply in writing for leave to sue or defend as a poor litigant, as per Order 5 of the Magistrate Court rules and Order 46 of the High Court rules. In criminal trials/ appeals, pro-deo lawyers (lawyers whose fees are paid directly by the government) can be assigned to defendants of limited financial means. Who is eligible? Any individual who is instigating or defending themselves against a civil case may apply for legal assistance from the courts.
